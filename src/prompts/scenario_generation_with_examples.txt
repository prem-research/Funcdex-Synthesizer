Create a realistic business scenario where someone would need to use multiple tools from these toolkits: {toolkit_names}.

Available toolkits:
{toolkit_descriptions}

Here are some existing scenarios for inspiration (your new scenario should be VERY DIFFERENT from the examples below):

{seed_scenarios_text}

# TASK
Generate a NEW specific, detailed scenario (2-3 sentences) that would naturally require using tools from multiple toolkits in sequence. The scenario should be realistic and represent a common business use case, but MUST be meaningfully different from the examples above.

Respond with just the scenario description, no additional formatting. Again, your new scenario should be VERY DIFFERENT from the examples above.
