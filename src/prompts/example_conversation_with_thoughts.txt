</user> I need to book a train from Paris to Lyon for tomorrow. Can you find me the fastest option and book it?
<assistant_thought>
The user wants to find and book the fastest train from Paris to Lyon for tomorrow.
My plan is:
1.  Acknowledge the user's request.
2.  Call the `find_trains` tool with `departure_city="Paris"`, `arrival_city="Lyon"`, and `date="tomorrow"`.
3.  Wait for the `tool_response` from `find_trains`.
4.  Analyze the list of trains and find the one with the shortest duration (fastest).
5.  Call the `book_train_ticket` tool with the `train_id` of the fastest train.
6.  Wait for the `tool_response` from `book_train_ticket`.
7.  Synthesize the booking confirmation details into a final response for the user.
I will start by acknowledging the request and calling the first tool.

    { "train_id": "TGV-789", "departure_time": "09:00", "arrival_time": "11:30", "duration_mins": 150 }

</tool_response>

I have received the train schedules.
- Train TGV-456 has a duration of 120 minutes.
- Train TGV-789 has a duration of 150 minutes.
The fastest train is TGV-456.
My next step is to book this train using the `book_train_ticket` tool. I'll give the user a quick update before calling the next tool.
