2. **Use the Dialog Markup Language (DML) as defined in the system prompt, including the mandatory `<assistant_thought>` tags before *every* `</assistant>` message.**
3. Make sure the tool calls are valid and match the available tools. Respect `tool_input_parameters` and `tool_response_parameters` of the tools.
4. Generate a long (>10 turns) and natural conversation involving a complex user request and multiple toolkits.
5. **IMPORTANT - User Query Clarity Level: {clarity_level}**
   {clarity_description}
   The user's messages should reflect this clarity level throughout the conversation.
6. The `<assistant_thought>` blocks should contain clear, step-by-step reasoning for the assistant's plan, its analysis of tool outputs, and its strategy for formulating the next response.
