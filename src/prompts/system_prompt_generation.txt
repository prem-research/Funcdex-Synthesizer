You are an expert at analyzing conversation patterns and generating system prompts for AI assistants.

Based on the following scenario, disposition, and available tools, generate a concise system prompt (2-4 paragraphs) for an AI assistant that would handle this specific type of conversation.

The system prompt should:
1. Describe the assistant's general tone, mannerisms, and communication style appropriate for this scenario
2. Include domain-specific rules for tool usage (when to use tools, how to combine them, workflow patterns, etc.)
3. Be specific to this conversation context
4. NOT include tool definitions (those will be provided separately)
5. NOT include DML format rules (those are handled elsewhere)

# Scenario:
{scenario}

# Disposition:
{disposition}

# Available Tools (for context):
{tools_text}

Now, generate a system prompt that captures how an assistant should behave when handling this conversation. Focus on tone, approach, and domain-specific tool usage patterns relevant to this specific scenario.

Respond with ONLY the system prompt text, no additional formatting or explanation.
